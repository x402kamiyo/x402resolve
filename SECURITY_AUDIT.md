# x402Resolve Security Audit Checklist

## Solana Program Security

### Access Control
- [x] Initialize escrow: Agent must sign transaction
- [x] Release funds: Authorized parties only (agent or anyone after expiration)
- [x] Mark disputed: Only agent can mark dispute before expiration
- [x] Resolve dispute: Verifier signature required and validated
- [x] PDA seeds use transaction_id (prevents collisions)
- [x] No admin privileges or centralized control

### Input Validation
- [x] Amount validation: MIN_ESCROW_AMOUNT (0.001 SOL) to MAX_ESCROW_AMOUNT (1000 SOL)
- [x] Time lock validation: MIN_TIME_LOCK (1 hour) to MAX_TIME_LOCK (30 days)
- [x] Transaction ID validation: Non-empty, max 64 characters
- [x] Quality score validation: 0-100 range
- [x] Refund percentage validation: 0-100 range
- [x] Dispute window enforcement: Cannot dispute after expiration

### Arithmetic Safety
- [x] Refund calculation uses checked_mul/checked_div
- [x] All arithmetic operations handle overflow
- [x] No unchecked integer operations

## Risk Assessment

### Critical Risks (Must Fix Before Mainnet)
1. Verifier registry not implemented (any address can be verifier)
2. No replay protection on signatures
3. Single verifier (no consensus)
4. No verifier staking/slashing

### High Risks (Should Fix)
1. Limited compute budget management
2. String-based transaction IDs (expensive)
3. No formal verification
4. Limited error recovery

### Medium Risks (Monitor)
1. Anchor version mismatch (CLI vs library)
2. Event data size (gas costs)
3. No emergency pause mechanism

### Low Risks (Acceptable for MVP)
1. Debug logging costs compute
2. No account compression
3. Single transaction workflow

## Recommendations

### Immediate (Before Mainnet)
1. Implement verifier registry with staking
2. Add timestamp + nonce to signature message
3. Multi-oracle consensus (3+ verifiers)
4. Professional security audit

### Short Term (1-3 months)
1. Bug bounty program
2. Formal verification of core logic
3. Emergency pause mechanism
4. Comprehensive monitoring

### Long Term (3-6 months)
1. DAO governance for parameters
2. Cross-chain support
3. Insurance products
4. Advanced privacy features

## Sign-Off

**Auditor**: Internal Review
**Date**: October 30, 2025
**Status**: Development (Devnet)
**Next Review**: Before mainnet deployment

**Summary**: Core security mechanisms in place. Critical items must be addressed before mainnet. Suitable for hackathon/devnet deployment.
