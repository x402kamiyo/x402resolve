# x402Resolve Interactive Demo

> **Solana x402 Hackathon Submission** - Live demonstration of automated dispute resolution for AI-generated data quality

## 🎯 What This Demo Shows

This interactive web demo showcases the complete x402Resolve dispute resolution workflow:

1. **File a Dispute** - User submits quality complaint for purchased data
2. **Automated Verification** - x402 Verifier Oracle analyzes data quality
3. **Quality Scoring** - Multi-factor AI scoring (semantic, completeness, freshness)
4. **Automatic Refund** - Solana smart contract processes refund based on score

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Option 1: Open Directly
Simply open `index.html` in your web browser. No build step required!

```bash
open demo/index.html
# or
python3 -m http.server 8080
# Then visit http://localhost:8080
```

### Option 2: Live Server
For best experience with hot reload:

```bash
# Using VS Code Live Server extension
# or
npx serve .
```

## 🎮 How to Use

1. **Select a Dispute Reason** from the dropdown
   - Data Incomplete
   - No Source Attribution
   - Wrong Blockchain Data
   - Outdated Information
   - Factually Inaccurate

2. **Set Expected Quality** (0-100)
   - Helps calibrate future quality expectations

3. **Add Evidence** (optional)
   - Describe specific quality issues

4. **Click "File Dispute on Solana"**
   - Watch the automated resolution process unfold!

## 🔬 Technology Showcase

### Quality Scoring Algorithm
The demo simulates the real x402 Verifier Oracle scoring:

- **Semantic Coherence (40%)**: Does data match query intent?
- **Completeness (40%)**: Are all required fields present?
- **Freshness (20%)**: Is the data recent and timely?

### Refund Calculation (Sliding Scale)
Based on quality score:

| Quality Score | Refund Amount |
|---------------|---------------|
| 90-100 | 0% (high quality) |
| 70-89 | 25% refund |
| 50-69 | 50% refund |
| 30-49 | 75% refund |
| 0-29 | 100% refund |

## 🎨 Features

- **Interactive UI**: Beautiful, responsive design
- **Real-time Timeline**: Visual progress tracking
- **Animated Scoring**: Quality metrics with smooth transitions
- **Multiple Scenarios**: Different dispute types show different outcomes
- **Mobile Responsive**: Works on all screen sizes

## 🏗️ Technical Architecture

The demo simulates the actual x402Resolve architecture:

1. **MCP Server** → Receives dispute from Claude Desktop
2. **x402 Verifier Oracle** → Python FastAPI service
3. **Solana Escrow** → Rust/Anchor smart contract
4. **Quality Scoring** → Sentence Transformers + sklearn
5. **Automated Refund** → On-chain execution

## 📝 For Hackathon Judges

This demo illustrates the key innovation of x402Resolve:

✅ **Automated** - No manual review required
✅ **Transparent** - Clear quality metrics
✅ **Fair** - Sliding scale refunds based on objective scores
✅ **Fast** - 24-48h resolution vs weeks/months
✅ **Verifiable** - All transactions on Solana blockchain
