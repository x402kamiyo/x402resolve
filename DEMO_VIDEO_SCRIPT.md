## Opening (0:00-0:30)

### Visuals
- Title card: "x402Resolve - Automated Dispute Resolution"
- Subtitle: "Solana x402 Hackathon 2025"
- Quick transition to problem statement

### Script
"When agents purchase API data with crypto, what happens when the data quality is poor? Traditional payments are irreversible. Chargebacks require human intervention and take weeks. Agents can't objectively verify quality.

x402Resolve solves this with automated dispute resolution. Let me show you how it works."

---

## The Problem (0:30-1:00)

### Visuals
- Split screen: Good data vs Bad data
- Agent frustrated with poor quality
- Traditional payment: No recourse

### Script
"Here's the problem: An agent pays 0.1 SOL for Uniswap exploit data. But receives Curve and Euler exploits instead - completely wrong protocols.

With traditional x402 payments, the agent is stuck with bad data and lost money. There's no automated way to get a refund.

x402Resolve changes this."

## The Solution (1:00-2:00)

### Visuals
- Architecture diagram
- Live demo: Terminal showing transaction flow

### Script
"Here's how x402Resolve works:

**Step 1**: Agent pays 0.1 SOL into escrow, not directly to the API.

**Step 2**: Agent receives data and checks quality automatically.

**Step 3**: If quality is poor, agent files dispute with one MCP command: file_dispute.

**Step 4**: Our verifier oracle scores quality using three factors:
- Semantic similarity: Do the exploits match the query?
- Completeness: Are all required fields present?
- Freshness: Is the data recent?

**Step 5**: Based on the quality score, a fair refund is calculated. Not binary - a sliding scale from 0 to 100%.

In this example, quality scored 45/100, so agent gets 75% refund automatically. No human intervention. Resolution in 24-48 hours."

### Demo Commands
```bash
# Show escrow creation
solana-explorer: [escrow PDA address]

# Show dispute filing
curl -X POST /api/v1/disputes

# Show quality score result
Quality: 45/100 â†’ 75% refund

# Show on-chain resolution
solana-explorer: [refund transaction]
```

## Innovation Highlights (2:00-2:30)

### Visuals
- Feature comparison table
- Architecture diagram

### Script
"What makes x402Resolve unique?

**First**: AI-powered quality scoring. Multi-factor algorithm, not manual review.

**Second**: Sliding scale refunds. Fair for both parties - not all-or-nothing.

**Third**: MCP integration. Agents file disputes automatically, no human needed.

**Fourth**: On-chain verification. Ed25519 signatures, Solana smart contracts, complete transparency.

This is production-ready infrastructure for the agent economy."
