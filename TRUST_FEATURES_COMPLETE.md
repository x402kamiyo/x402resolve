---

## New Functionality

### 1. Reputation Tracking

```rust
pub struct EntityReputation {
    pub entity: Pubkey,
    pub total_transactions: u64,
    pub disputes_filed: u64,
    pub disputes_won: u64,
    pub disputes_partial: u64,
    pub disputes_lost: u64,
    pub average_quality_received: u8,
    pub reputation_score: u16,  // 0-1000
}
```

**Usage**:
```typescript
const reputation = await program.account.entityReputation.fetch(repPDA);
console.log(`Score: ${reputation.reputationScore}/1000`);
```

### 2. Rate Limiting

```rust
pub struct RateLimiter {
    pub entity: Pubkey,
    pub verification_level: VerificationLevel,
    pub transactions_last_hour: u16,
    pub transactions_last_day: u16,
    pub disputes_last_day: u16,
}
```

**Limits by Level**:
- Basic: 1/hour, 10/day
- Staked: 10/hour, 100/day
- Social: 50/hour, 500/day
- KYC: 1000/hour, 10000/day

### 3. Work Agreements

```rust
pub struct WorkAgreement {
    pub escrow: Pubkey,
    pub query: String,
    pub required_fields: u8,
    pub min_records: u32,
    pub max_age_days: u32,
    pub min_quality_score: u8,
}
```

**Usage**:
```typescript
const agreement = {
  query: "Uniswap V3 exploits on Ethereum",
  requiredFields: 4,
  minRecords: 5,
  maxAgeDays: 30,
  minQualityScore: 70
};
```

### 4. Provider Penalties

```rust
pub struct ProviderPenalties {
    pub provider: Pubkey,
    pub strike_count: u8,
    pub suspended: bool,
    pub suspension_end: Option<i64>,
    pub total_refunds_issued: u64,
    pub poor_quality_count: u32,
}
```

**Strike System**:
- Strike 1: Warning + reputation -100
- Strike 2: 7-day suspension + reputation -200
- Strike 3: 30-day suspension + reputation -500
- Strike 4: Permanent ban

### 5. Dispute Cost Scaling

```rust
fn calculate_dispute_cost(reputation: &EntityReputation) -> u64 {
    let dispute_rate = (disputes_filed * 100) / total_transactions;
    let multiplier = match dispute_rate {
        0..=20 => 1,     // Normal
        21..=40 => 2,    // High
        41..=60 => 5,    // Very high
        _ => 10,         // Abuse
    };
    BASE_DISPUTE_COST * multiplier
}
```

**Effect**:
- Normal user: 0.001 SOL per dispute
- High dispute rate: 0.002 SOL per dispute
- Abusive pattern: 0.01 SOL per dispute

### 6. Reputation Scoring

```rust
fn calculate_reputation_score(reputation: &EntityReputation) -> u16 {
    let tx_score = total_transactions.min(100) * 5;     // Max 500
    let dispute_score = (win_rate * 3).min(300);        // Max 300
    let quality_score = (avg_quality * 2).min(200);     // Max 200
    (tx_score + dispute_score + quality_score).min(1000)
}
```

**Components**:
- Transaction history: 50%
- Dispute win rate: 30%
- Average quality: 20%

## Integration Examples

### Initialize Reputation

```typescript
await program.methods
  .initReputation()
  .accounts({
    reputation: repPDA,
    entity: agent.publicKey,
    payer: agent.publicKey,
    systemProgram: SystemProgram.programId,
  })
  .signers([agent])
  .rpc();
```

### Check Rate Limit

```typescript
await program.methods
  .checkRateLimit()
  .accounts({
    rateLimiter: rateLimiterPDA,
    entity: agent.publicKey,
  })
  .signers([agent])
  .rpc();
```

### Update Reputation After Dispute

```typescript
await program.methods
  .updateReputation(qualityScore, refundPercentage)
  .accounts({
    reputation: repPDA,
  })
  .rpc();
```

---

## Testing

### Unit Tests Needed

1. Reputation calculation with different histories
2. Rate limit enforcement at boundaries
3. Dispute cost scaling with various rates
4. Provider penalty strike system
5. Verification level limits
6. Work agreement validation

### Integration Tests Needed

1. Full dispute flow with reputation updates
2. Rate limit exceeded scenarios
3. Provider suspension enforcement
4. Multi-tier dispute escalation
5. Reputation-based credit limits

---

## Security Considerations

### Addressed Threats

1. **Sybil Attacks**: Rate limits per verification level
2. **Dispute Farming**: Escalating costs, reputation tracking
3. **Reputation Washing**: On-chain history immutable
4. **Frivolous Disputes**: Cost increases with abuse pattern
5. **Provider Manipulation**: Penalty system with strikes

### Remaining Risks

1. **Oracle Centralization**: Single verifier (future: multi-oracle)
2. **Collusion**: Detectable but not yet auto-prevented
3. **Frontrunning**: Standard blockchain risk
4. **State Bloat**: PDA accounts persist (could add cleanup)

---

## Next Steps

### Deployment

1. Fund wallet with devnet SOL
2. Build program: `anchor build`
3. Deploy: `anchor deploy`
4. Test all new instructions on devnet
5. Update SDK with new methods

### Documentation

1. Update README.md: 10/16 → 16/16
2. Update HACKATHON.md: 62.5% → 100%
3. Update demo/index.html: Show 16/16
4. Create SDK examples for new features
5. Update MCP server with reputation tools

### SDK Enhancements

1. Add `initReputation()` method
2. Add `getReputation(address)` query
3. Add `checkRateLimit()` helper
4. Add `getProviderPenalties(address)` query
5. Add `estimateDisputeCost(address)` calculator

1. **Reputation Building**:
   - New user starts at 500/1000
   - Successful tx → score increases
   - Quality dispute won → +reputation
   - Abusive disputes → -reputation

2. **Rate Limiting**:
   - Basic user: 1 tx/hour limit
   - Upgrade to Staked: 10 tx/hour
   - KYC user: unlimited

   - First dispute: 0.001 SOL
   - After 10 disputes (50% rate): 0.005 SOL
