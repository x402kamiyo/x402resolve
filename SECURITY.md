### Bug Bounty

We currently do not have a formal bug bounty program, but we:

- Recognize security researchers in our security advisories
- Consider security contributions for future bounty programs
- Provide attribution in release notes

## Security Features

### Smart Contract Security

**Solana Escrow Program** (`packages/x402-escrow/`)

1. **PDA-Based Escrow**
   - Deterministic addresses prevent theft
   - No private keys to compromise
   - Program-controlled funds only

2. **Time-Lock Protection**
   - Maximum 7-day escrow duration
   - Automatic release prevents indefinite holds
   - Clear dispute window enforcement

3. **Signature Verification**
   - Ed25519 signature validation on-chain
   - Oracle assessments cryptographically proven
   - Prevents signature replay attacks

4. **Access Controls**
   - Role-based permissions (client, provider, verifier)
   - Signer validation for all instructions
   - Account ownership checks

5. **Integer Overflow Protection**
   - Checked arithmetic operations
   - Safe math for refund calculations
   - Validated percentage calculations (0-100)

### Oracle Security

**Verifier Oracle** (`packages/x402-verifier/`)

1. **Private Key Management**
   - Ed25519 keypair for signing assessments
   - Environment variable configuration
   - Never logged or transmitted

2. **Input Validation**
   - Schema validation for all requests
   - Query string sanitization
   - Data size limits enforced

3. **Rate Limiting**
   - Per-IP request limits
   - Prevents DoS attacks
   - Graduated verification levels

4. **API Authentication**
   - Bearer token authentication
   - API key rotation support
   - Request signature verification

### SDK Security

**TypeScript SDK** (`packages/x402-sdk/`)

1. **Wallet Integration**
   - No private key handling
   - Uses wallet adapters only
   - User signs all transactions

2. **Input Sanitization**
   - Query parameter validation
   - Amount range checks
   - Address format validation

3. **Connection Security**
   - HTTPS-only endpoints
   - RPC endpoint validation
   - Timeout protections

## Known Security Considerations

### Current Limitations

1. **Single Oracle (Phase 1)**
   - Current implementation uses single verifier oracle
   - Risk: Oracle compromise could affect assessments
   - Mitigation: Multi-oracle consensus planned for Phase 2

2. **Oracle Centralization**
   - Verifier oracle operated by KAMIYO
   - Risk: Single point of failure
   - Mitigation: Decentralized oracle network in Phase 2

3. **Time-Lock Duration**
   - 7-day maximum escrow period
   - Risk: Complex disputes may need longer review
   - Mitigation: Multi-tier escalation system planned

4. **Smart Contract Upgrades**
   - Current program is not upgradeable
   - Risk: Bug fixes require new deployment
   - Mitigation: Thorough testing before mainnet deployment

### Threat Model

**In Scope**:
- Smart contract vulnerabilities (reentrancy, overflow, access control)
- Oracle manipulation or signature forgery
- RPC endpoint attacks
- Input validation bypasses
- Logic errors in quality scoring
- Time-lock exploitation

**Out of Scope**:
- Social engineering attacks on users
- Compromised user wallets/private keys
- Solana network-level issues
- Third-party service vulnerabilities
- Physical security of infrastructure
- Denial of service (DoS/DDoS)

## Security Best Practices

### For Users

1. **Wallet Security**
   - Never share your private key or seed phrase
   - Use hardware wallets for large amounts
   - Verify transaction details before signing
   - Keep wallet software updated

2. **Transaction Verification**
   - Verify recipient addresses
   - Check escrow parameters (amount, time-lock)
   - Review quality criteria before payment
   - Monitor transaction status

3. **Dispute Filing**
   - Collect evidence before filing disputes
   - Understand refund calculation methodology
   - Be aware of dispute costs
   - Track dispute resolution timeline

### For Developers

1. **API Key Management**
   - Store API keys in environment variables
   - Rotate keys regularly
   - Use different keys for dev/staging/production
   - Never commit keys to version control

2. **Input Validation**
   - Validate all user inputs
   - Sanitize query strings
   - Check numeric ranges
   - Verify address formats

3. **Error Handling**
   - Don't expose sensitive information in errors
   - Log security events appropriately
   - Handle edge cases gracefully
   - Fail securely

4. **Testing**
   - Test with malicious inputs
   - Verify signature checking
   - Test time-lock boundaries
   - Simulate oracle failures

### For Oracle Operators

1. **Key Management**
   - Generate keys in secure environment
   - Store private keys encrypted
   - Use HSM for production keys
   - Implement key rotation

2. **Infrastructure Security**
   - Keep systems patched and updated
   - Use firewalls and network segmentation
   - Monitor for suspicious activity
   - Implement intrusion detection

3. **Operational Security**
   - Audit assessment logs regularly
   - Monitor quality score distributions
   - Alert on unusual patterns
   - Backup critical data
