# MCP Integration Example

Demonstrates how Claude Desktop uses the KAMIYO MCP server to automatically file disputes for poor data quality.

## Use Case

Use this when:
- You're an AI agent (like Claude Desktop)
- You need crypto exploit intelligence
- You want automated quality verification
- You want to file disputes programmatically via MCP

## How It Works

```
User → Ask Claude for exploit data
        ↓
Claude → Use search_crypto_exploits MCP tool
        ↓
KAMIYO API → Return data
        ↓
Claude → Evaluate quality automatically
        ↓
    ┌─────────────┴─────────────┐
    │                           │
Quality OK?              Quality Poor?
    │                           │
    ↓                           ↓
Return results          Use file_dispute MCP tool
to user                        ↓
                        x402 Verifier Oracle
                               ↓
                        Quality Score: 45/100
                               ↓
                        Refund: 75%
                               ↓
                        Notify user
```

## Setup

### 1. Configure Claude Desktop

Create or edit `~/.config/claude/mcp_config.json`:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "kamiyo-security": {
      "command": "python3.11",
      "args": [
        "/absolute/path/to/kamiyo-x402-solana/packages/mcp-server/server.py"
      ],
      "env": {
        "ENVIRONMENT": "development",
        "KAMIYO_API_URL": "http://localhost:8000",
        "X402_VERIFIER_URL": "http://localhost:8001",
        "SOLANA_RPC_URL": "https://api.devnet.solana.com",
        "MCP_JWT_SECRET": "dev_jwt_secret_change_in_production"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### 2. Install MCP Server Dependencies

```bash
cd ../../packages/mcp-server
pip3.11 install -r requirements-mcp.txt
```

### 3. Start Required Services

```bash
# Terminal 1: KAMIYO API (optional - can use mock data)
cd path/to/kamiyo/api
python main.py

# Terminal 2: x402 Verifier Oracle
cd ../../packages/x402-verifier
python verifier.py

# Terminal 3: Test MCP server
cd ../../packages/mcp-server
python server.py --help
```

### 4. Restart Claude Desktop

After configuring MCP, restart Claude Desktop to load the server.

## Example Interaction

### Scenario 1: Good Quality Data

```
User:
Search for Uniswap V3 exploits on Ethereum

Claude:
I'll search for Uniswap V3 exploits on Ethereum using the KAMIYO security database.

[Uses search_crypto_exploits MCP tool]

I found 8 Uniswap V3 exploits on Ethereum:

1. **Uniswap V3 Reentrancy** (2024-03-15)
   - Amount: $1,200,000
   - TX: 0x7a8b9c...
   - Source: BlockSec

2. **Uniswap V3 Oracle Manipulation** (2024-02-10)
   - Amount: $850,000
   - TX: 0x9d4e5f...
   - Source: PeckShield

[... 6 more exploits]

All results have complete blockchain verification and source attribution.
Quality assessment: HIGH ✅
```

### Scenario 2: Poor Quality Data → Automatic Dispute

```
User:
Search for Curve Finance exploits on Ethereum, I need comprehensive data

Claude:
I'll search for Curve Finance exploits on Ethereum.

[Uses search_crypto_exploits MCP tool]

I found 3 results, but I notice some quality issues:

1. **Euler Finance** - $8.2M
   ⚠️ Wrong protocol (not Curve)
   ⚠️ Missing transaction hash

2. **Mango Markets** - $1.5M
   ⚠️ Wrong chain (Solana, not Ethereum)
   ⚠️ Missing source attribution

3. **Wintermute** - $160M
   ⚠️ Wrong protocol
   ⚠️ Incomplete data

Quality issues detected:
• Wrong protocols (expected Curve, got Euler/Mango/Wintermute)
• Wrong blockchain (Solana instead of Ethereum)
• Missing required fields (tx_hash, source)
• Incomplete dataset (3 vs 10+ expected)

Let me file a dispute for poor data quality...

[Uses file_dispute MCP tool]

✅ Dispute filed successfully!

Dispute ID: dispute_x402_xyz789
Status: Pending verification
Estimated resolution: 24-48 hours

x402 Verifier Oracle will analyze the data quality using:
• Semantic coherence (40%): Does data match "Curve Finance on Ethereum"?
• Completeness (40%): Are transaction hashes and sources present?
• Freshness (20%): Is the data recent?

Based on the issues I identified, I estimate you'll receive a 75% refund
(approximately $7.50 of your $10.00 payment) once the quality score is
calculated.

I'll notify you when the dispute is resolved.
```

### Scenario 3: Dispute Resolution

```
User:
What's the status of my dispute?

Claude:
Let me check the status of your dispute (dispute_x402_xyz789)...

[Uses search or monitoring capability]

✅ Dispute resolved!

Quality Assessment:
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
Overall Score: 45/100 (POOR QUALITY)

Breakdown:
• Semantic Coherence: 60%
  ├─ Query: "Curve Finance on Ethereum"
  └─ Data: Mixed protocols (Euler, Mango, Wintermute)

• Completeness: 40%
  ├─ Missing tx_hash: 2/3 records
  └─ Missing source: 2/3 records

• Freshness: 100%
  └─ All data within 30 days ✓

Refund Details:
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
Refund Percentage: 75%
Refund Amount: $7.50 (0.0075 SOL)
API Keeps: $2.50 (0.0025 SOL)

Solana Transaction: 7LPz4kQ9...
Resolution Time: 18 hours
Verifier Signature: 0x1a2b3c...

The refund has been automatically processed to your wallet. You received
75% back because the data quality was significantly below acceptable
standards (45/100 vs 80/100 threshold).
```

## Expected Output

When you use Claude Desktop with the KAMIYO MCP server, you'll see:

1. **MCP Server Logs** (in terminal):
```
[INFO] Starting KAMIYO MCP Server v1.0.0
[INFO] Environment: development
[INFO] Available tools: health_check, search_crypto_exploits, assess_defi_protocol_risk, monitor_wallet, file_dispute
[INFO] MCP Server started successfully
[INFO] Tool invoked: search_crypto_exploits
[INFO] Tool invoked: file_dispute (quality score: 45)
```

2. **Claude Desktop Interface**:
- Claude will show MCP tool usage in the UI
- You'll see real-time tool invocations
- Results are presented naturally in conversation

## Testing

### Test 1: Basic Search (No Dispute)

```bash
# In Claude Desktop:
User: "Search for recent Ethereum exploits"
```

Expected: Claude uses `search_crypto_exploits` and returns results.

### Test 2: Automatic Dispute

```bash
# In Claude Desktop:
User: "Search for Uniswap exploits, I need high-quality data"
```

If data quality is poor, Claude should automatically:
1. Detect quality issues
2. Explain the problems
3. File dispute using `file_dispute` tool
4. Provide dispute ID and estimated refund

### Test 3: Health Check

```bash
# In Claude Desktop:
User: "Check if the KAMIYO MCP server is working"
```

Expected: Claude uses `health_check` and reports status.

## Key Benefits

✅ **Automated Quality Control**: Claude detects poor data automatically
✅ **No Manual Disputes**: Dispute filing is programmatic via MCP
✅ **Transparent Scoring**: Multi-factor AI quality assessment
✅ **Fair Refunds**: 0-100% sliding scale based on objective scores
✅ **Fast Resolution**: 24-48h automated processing
✅ **Blockchain Verified**: All transactions on Solana

## Troubleshooting

### MCP Server Not Showing in Claude

1. Check `mcp_config.json` path is correct
2. Verify Python 3.11+ is installed
3. Ensure dependencies installed: `pip3.11 install -r requirements-mcp.txt`
4. Check server starts manually: `python3.11 server.py --help`
5. Restart Claude Desktop

### Dispute Filing Fails

1. Ensure x402 Verifier Oracle is running (`python verifier.py`)
2. Check `X402_VERIFIER_URL` in config
3. Verify network connectivity
4. Check server logs for errors

### Data Quality Always Poor

This is intentional for demo! The system is designed to show dispute resolution.
In production, quality varies based on actual data returned by KAMIYO API.
