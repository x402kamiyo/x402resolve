**Total potential:** $40,000 in prizes

---

## Execution Plan: Days 1-12

### Days 1-2: Extract & Integrate (PRIORITY)

**Goal:** Bring existing KAMIYO components into hackathon repo

#### Task 1.1: Extract MCP Server
```bash
# Source
cp -r /Users/dennisgoslar/Projekter/kamiyo/mcp-server \
      /Users/dennisgoslar/Projekter/kamiyo-x402-solana/packages/

# Clean up
- Remove hardcoded API keys
- Add .env.example
- Update README for hackathon
- Add x402Resolve integration
```

**New feature:** MCP server now supports dispute filing
```typescript
// packages/mcp-server/tools/dispute.ts
{
  name: "file_dispute",
  description: "File a dispute for poor data quality",
  inputSchema: {
    type: "object",
    properties: {
      transactionId: { type: "string" },
      reason: { type: "string" },
      expectedQuality: { type: "number" }
    }
  }
}
```

#### Task 1.2: Create Simplified Frontend Demo
```bash
# Extract
cp -r /Users/dennisgoslar/Projekter/kamiyo/pages/index.js \
      /Users/dennisgoslar/Projekter/kamiyo-x402-solana/packages/frontend/

# Simplify
- Keep: Homepage, API docs, pricing
- Remove: Dashboard, billing, webhooks
- Add: Dispute resolution demo page
- Use: Mock data instead of real aggregators
```

**New page:** `/resolve-demo` showing live dispute resolution

#### Task 1.3: Document Existing x402 Payment System
```markdown
# docs/X402_PAYMENT_FLOW.md

Currently deployed at kamiyo.ai:

1. Agent queries API → 402 Payment Required
2. API returns payment address + amount
3. Agent pays USDC on Solana
4. API verifies payment signature
5. Agent receives access token (24h expiry)
6. Agent makes authenticated queries

**NEW:** With x402Resolve, if data quality is poor:
7. Agent files dispute
8. Verifier Oracle assesses quality
9. Automatic partial refund issued
```

### Days 3-4: Integration Testing

**Goal:** Ensure all components work together

#### Task 2.1: End-to-End Test Flow
```bash
# Terminal 1: Start verifier
cd packages/x402-verifier
python verifier.py

# Terminal 2: Run demo
cd examples/agent-dispute
python scenario.py

# Expected output:
# ✅ Payment to escrow: 0.01 SOL
# ✅ Data received (3 exploits)
# ✅ Dispute filed
# ✅ Quality score: 65/100
# ✅ Refund: 35% (0.0035 SOL)
# ✅ Total time: 8 seconds
```

#### Task 2.2: MCP Integration Test
```bash
# Install in Claude Desktop
# Test commands:
# - "Search recent Solana exploits"
# - "File a dispute for transaction tx_123"
# - "Check dispute status"
```

#### Task 2.3: Create Integration Examples

**Example 1:** Basic payment (no disputes)
```typescript
// examples/basic-payment/index.ts
const client = new KamiyoClient({ ... });
const data = await client.pay({ amount: 0.01 });
console.log('Received', data.exploits.length, 'exploits');
```

**Example 2:** Payment with dispute
```typescript
// examples/with-dispute/index.ts
const payment = await client.pay({ amount: 0.01, enableEscrow: true });
const data = await client.query({ ... });

if (data.exploits.length < expected) {
  const dispute = await client.dispute({
    transactionId: payment.transactionId,
    reason: 'Incomplete data',
    ...
  });
  console.log('Refund:', dispute.refundPercentage + '%');
}
```

**Example 3:** MCP + Dispute
```python
# examples/mcp-with-disputes/claude_agent.py
# Claude agent that:
# 1. Searches exploits via MCP
# 2. Detects incomplete results
# 3. Files dispute automatically
# 4. Gets refund
```

### Days 5-7: Documentation Sprint

**Goal:** Comprehensive, hackathon-ready documentation

#### Task 3.1: Update Main README

```markdown
# x402Resolve: Dispute Resolution for AI Agent Payments

## The Problem

AI agents pay for APIs, but what if the data quality is poor?
- Traditional payments: irreversible
- Chargebacks: require humans, take weeks
- Result: Agents stuck with bad data, no recourse

## The Solution

x402Resolve adds **automated dispute resolution** to HTTP 402 payments:

1. **Escrow**: Agent pays to time-locked escrow (not directly to API)
2. **Verification**: If data quality poor, agent files dispute
3. **Oracle**: AI-powered verifier assesses quality (0-100 score)
4. **Resolution**: Automatic partial refund based on quality
5. **Time**: Entire process takes ~8 seconds

## Why This Wins

**vs. Standard x402:**
- Standard: Payment → Data (irreversible)
- x402Resolve: Payment → Escrow → Quality Check → Fair Split

**vs. Traditional Disputes:**
- Traditional: Days/weeks, human mediators, expensive
- x402Resolve: Seconds, AI verifier, $0.00025 cost

**Why Solana:**
- Ethereum: 180s finality, $15 fees → Not viable
- Solana: 0.4s finality, $0.00025 fees → Perfect for disputes

# Solana x402 Hackathon Submission

## Project: x402Resolve

**Tagline:** Automated dispute resolution for AI agent payments on Solana

## Categories

Competing in FOUR prize categories:
1. **Best MCP Server** - Claude Desktop integration
2. **Best x402 Dev Tool** - SDK + Verifier Oracle
3. **Best x402 Agent Application** - Security intelligence
4. **Best x402 API Integration** - Dispute resolution protocol

## Problem

$2.1B stolen in crypto exploits (H1 2025). AI agents need security data but can't:
- Sign up for accounts
- Use credit cards
- Resolve payment disputes

**Current x402 solutions:** Agents can pay, but what if data quality is poor? No recourse.

## Solution: x402Resolve

Three-layer automated dispute resolution:

**Layer 1: Solana Escrow Program** (Rust/Anchor)
- Holds payments in time-locked escrow
- Auto-release after dispute window
- Splits funds based on quality score

**Layer 2: Verifier Oracle** (Python/FastAPI)
- AI-powered quality assessment
- Multi-factor scoring (semantic, completeness, freshness)
- Returns quality score (0-100) + refund recommendation

**Layer 3: TypeScript SDK**
- Client library for agents
- Handles payments, disputes, monitoring
- Event-driven architecture

## Innovation

**First-Ever:**
- ✅ Automated quality assessment for API responses
- ✅ Programmatic refund calculation (0-100% sliding scale)
- ✅ Sub-10 second dispute resolution
- ✅ Zero human intervention required

**vs. Competitors:**
- Other x402 implementations: Just payments (no disputes)
- Traditional escrows: Manual release (no quality scoring)
- Chargebacks: Human mediators, takes weeks

## Why Solana?

**Requirements for dispute resolution:**
- Fast finality (verify → assess → refund quickly)
- Low fees (make micropayment disputes viable)
- Smart contract support (escrow logic)

**Comparison:**
| Feature | Solana | Ethereum | Traditional |
|---------|--------|----------|-------------|
| Finality | 0.4s | 180s | N/A |
| Fees | $0.00025 | $15 | $50+ |
| Dispute Time | 8s | 3+ min | Days/weeks |

**Verdict:** Only Solana makes automated micropayment disputes economically viable.

### Days 8-10: Demo Video Production

**Goal:** Create compelling 3-minute video

#### Task 4.1: Script Refinement

**Hook (0:00-0:10):**
> "$2.1 billion stolen in crypto exploits. First half of 2025 alone. What if AI agents could automatically dispute poor security data and get instant refunds?"

**Problem (0:10-0:30):**
- Show agent trying to pay for data
- Gets poor quality data
- Traditional: No recourse, money lost
- "This breaks AI agent commerce"

**Solution (0:30-1:00):**
- Introduce x402Resolve
- Show 3-layer architecture
- "Automated dispute resolution in 8 seconds"

**Live Demo (1:00-2:15):**
- Agent pays 0.01 SOL to escrow
- Receives incomplete data (3 exploits instead of 10)
- Files dispute
- Verifier assesses: 65/100 quality
- **Show Solana Explorer:** Refund transaction confirmed
- Agent receives 0.0035 SOL back (35%)
- API keeps 0.0065 SOL (65% for 65% quality)

**Why Solana (2:15-2:35):**
- Split screen: Solana vs Ethereum
- "Only Solana makes this economically viable"

**Traction + CTA (2:35-3:00):**
- "Already processing payments at kamiyo.ai"
- "Open sourcing for hackathon"
- "Four prize categories"
- "Try it: kamiyo.ai/resolve-demo"

| Secrets leaked | Security breach | Automated scanning, manual review |
| Demo doesn't work | Poor impression | Test multiple times, video backup |
| Unclear value prop | Judges don't get it | Lead with problem + 8-second resolution |
| Too complex | TL;DR syndrome | Simple demo first, depth in docs |

---

## Next Actions

1. **Immediate:** Extract MCP server from main repo
2. **Day 1-2:** Complete integration
3. **Day 3-4:** Test everything
4. **Day 5-7:** Documentation sprint
5. **Day 8-10:** Video production
6. **Day 11-12:** Final testing + submit

**Critical Path:**
- MCP extraction → Integration testing → Documentation → Video → Submit

**Deadline:** November 11, 2025 (12 days from now)

## The Winning Pitch

> "While every other x402 submission shows agents paying for APIs, x402Resolve shows what happens when agents get bad data and need refunds—automatically, in 8 seconds, with zero human intervention. This is the trust layer the AI agent economy needs. Built on Solana."

**This is how we win.** 🏆
